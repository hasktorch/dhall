# Hasktorch's dhall definitions

This allows cabal files to share common functions and types across hasktorch projects.

WARNING: These definitions depend on the unrelease dhall-to-cabal 1.3.0.1 (for correct backpack support).
Because of this, you need to build dhall-to-cabal from source on the HEAD of master.
